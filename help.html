        <UL>
            <li>To begin the game, click on any cell.</li>
            <li>Once the game has begun, the timer will start counting up to keep track of how long the game lasts.</li>
            <li>The numbers that are displayed indicate the number of mines that are adjacent to that square.</li>
            <li>You can flag a square you believe is covering a mine by right-clicking on that square. If you wish
            to remove a flag you have placed, just right-click the square again.
            </li>
            <li>The black box on the left-hand side will keep track of how many mines you have left to flag.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the numbers and click on other squares.</li>
            <li>If at any point during the game you click on a square covering a mine, the game will end.</li>
            <li>If you successfully uncover all the safe squares without hitting a mine, you win!</li>

        <h1>Implementation details:</h1>
        This game turned out to be much more difficult to implement that I originally thought. The most difficult part was the
        "cascade" algorithm. I found a description of the algorithm <a href="http://www.techuser.net/minecascade.html">here</a>, which was
        particularly helpful. The algorithm checks the neighbors of the clicked cell, counting the number of mines. If that number is zero,
        it iteratively checks the neighbors of each of those cells. If the number is not zero, it displays the count in that cell.
        <p>
        I created several custom images to be used in the game (the number squares, face button, etc.) I also used some
        free-licensed images which are acknowledged on the main game page. This project taught me a lot about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I had to
        use each of these extensively in order to make this game work and look like I wanted it to.
